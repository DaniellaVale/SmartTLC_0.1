## Summary

Smart-TLC is a Python-based open-source software for semi-automated thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, combining computer vision and machine learning (CNN) techniques. The tool enables image acquisition from a webcam, grayscale-based normalization of chromatographic spots, and quantitative analysis through polynomial regression models to estimate analyte concentrations. Its graphical user interface (developed in Flet) follows user experience (UX) principles, making it accessible even for non-programmers. Validation tests with standard solutions confirmed high accuracy and reproducibility, with R² exceeding 0.95. Smart-TLC provides a low-cost, transparent alternative to traditional densitometric systems and supports democratization of TLC analysis in research and educational environments.

## Statement of Need

Thin-layer chromatography remains a low-cost, accessible analytical technique but traditionally depends on expensive densitometric instruments. Smart-TLC fills a technological gap by providing:

- a user-friendly interface
- webcam-based image acquisition
- automated normalization of spots
- polynomial quantification
- offline, free, and open-source operation

It empowers researchers and students to perform semi-quantitative and quantitative TLC analysis without requiring advanced programming skills or costly equipment.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python ≥ 3.10  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow  
- Pandas  
- Pillow  
- Flet  
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Features
Webcam-based TLC plate image capture

Coordinate-based cropping and storage of metadata

Automatic grayscale normalization

Quantitative analysis by quadratic regression

Visualization of normalized spot areas in bar charts

Modular and intuitive UX-based graphical interface
